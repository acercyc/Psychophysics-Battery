quick CSF Demo Software Package (Beta version)

This MATLAB code complements the quick CSF method presented in:

Lesmes, Lu, Baek, & Albright (in press). Bayesian Adaptive 
Estimation of Contrast Sensitivity Functions: the quick CSF (qCSF) method 
Journal of Vision

The files in this folder implement the quick CSF method. The qCSF demo
presented as Movie 1 in the JOV paper is generated by 'qCSF_Demo.m'. This
program is heavily commented and provides the best view of how the
programs below are used in the context of an experiment or simulation.
In addition to this readme file, the unzipped package should contain 12 MATLAB files:

1. qCSF_Demo.m
2. setupQCSF.m
3. setupSimulation.m
4. setupPriors.m
5. runQCSF_BETA.m
6. runQCSF_BETA.p
7. quickCSF.fig
8. quickCSFv6.fig 
9. findQCSF.m
10. discretesamplev6.m
11. fitSechCost.m
12. marginalize.m

For some explanation of these files:

1. qCSF_Demo.m

	The main file.
	To run, open MATLAB, change your current 
	directory, and type 'qCSF_Demo':

2. setupQCSF.m
3. setupSimulation.m
4. setupPriors.m

	These three programs, called at the beginning of 'qCSF_Demo.m', 
	setup different features of a qCSF application. It might be
	useful to change and rename these files for different 
	experiments or experimental setups: e.g. setupQCSF_rig1.m, 
	or setupPriors_Amblyopes.m


5. runQCSF_BETA.m
6. runQCSF_BETA.p

	These files contain the qCSF "engine". For trial to trial
	business or pre- or post-trial analysis or plotting, 
	'runQCSF_BETA.m' is called. Type 'help runQCSF_BETA' to see usage. 
	The '.m' file contains the help and the '.p' file contains the code. 

7. quickCSF.fig
8. quickCSFv6.fig 
	These figures are used for plotting simulation or experiment results.


9.  findQCSF.m
10. discretesamplev6.m
11. fitSechCost.m
12. marginalize.m
	These are short useful files that are called to generate CSFs from
	CSF parameters, and to manipulate (generate, sample, marginalize) the
	parameter probability distributions used for Bayesian inference.
